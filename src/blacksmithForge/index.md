I made a blacksmith forge out of the structure of a toy. Honestly, I could have made it without the structure underneath and it might have actually turned just as good, but I like the constraint that using a pre-made structure adds.

This is the original toy I found in a second hand shop.

The plastic was very brittle, so I started by removing all the walls and unscrewing it. I would then glue it back together, but I didn't want any small part to break as I was working on it.

It was also a bit too deep, so I added a fake back wall with a foam board. I thought it could also act as some kind of house for the blacksmith.

I started working on cutting foam in bricks.

Which gave me a fair amount. I textured them by throwing them in a box with some real stones and shaking it until the stone texture was embedded in the foam bricks.

And then, it's just a matter of gluing the bricks one by one on all the walls. I do it with a glue gun, applying glue on the back of each brick and gluing them to the walls.

I added some windows and doors from Lego pieces and miniature leftovers I had.

I decorated the forge area with some more toys and miniature stuff.

Upstairs I engraved the floor with some tiles pattern, and built a shack out of some balsa wood and popsicle sticks.

To make the side slightly more interesting I ever get to play a skirmish game with this terrain, I added a small wooded part.

Painting stones in various colors for variety, using highly diluted paint, and adding a glow effect on the embers.

Added ramshackle wooden planks as some kind of ceiling. Not sure it makes sense that a forge ceiling would be made of wood but hey.

The top shack is not glued, for easier storage and also because it can be used in other contexts.
