Painting is fine, but what do you do with all those minis you have lying around.
And how do you manage to pick the correct mini when you need it?

Because I've been using the Dip Painting methods, all my minis were already
protected by a fair amount of varnish. The Dip Painting adds a glossy effect to
the minis, so I even add a second coat of matte varnish on top of it.

Those two layers means that the paint is well protected and I can just throw the
minis in a box and be sure they won't lose paint. That helps solve part of the
space storage problem, but still does not help in finding the correct mini when
I need one.

At first I bought transparent plastic boxes, of the kind you use for storing
food. It has the benefit of being transparent so you can see what's inside, and
can also stack well. It kinda works, but is not perfect yet.

Then I discovered the [storage boxes from Sally 4th][1]. They are a bit more
expensive, but provide a much better storage and display solution. Those are
wooden boxes of varying height (I take the 70mm usually). I always add a steel
sheet at the bottom so my magnetized minis can be attached to it.

The boxes stacks quite well, and I also ordered one clean size (with a plastic
glass), so I can see what's in each of them easily. I also line up the bottom
with one of their pre-decouped 25mm round holes sheets so I can put all my minis
in nice rows. I haven't done it for all the boxes as I have minis on larger (or
smaller) bases.

Having a way to store the minis, while still being able to see them and access
them easily is a big win for me.
