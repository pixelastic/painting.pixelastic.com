When I started my collection again, I had  abunch of old GW bases lying around.
They were all of various shapes and size (square, round, small and large). I had
no specific plan in mind on which base was better.

After all, I was about to play roleplay games, not wargames, so it was more akin
to a skirmish game and I didn't need to have minis neatly ordered in rows of
a regiment. If one was on a square base and another on a round was not an issue.
Or so I thought.

At some point I even bought an old incomplete Scrabble game in a garage sales,
because I knew that once repainted, the letters could make perfectly acceptable
bases.

All of that worked well for a time, but at some point I moved on to adding
magnets at the bottom of my minis (for easier storage). Because of the unusual
shape of the Scrabble pieces, I had to manually cut the magnet from the
magnetized sticker sheet. That was long and messy, and not how I wanted to spend
my limited time on the painting desk.

At some point, I decided that I should only use 25mm round bases (the default
round GW one, used on Space Marines minis). It was a standard size, so it was
easy to find pre-cut magnets to put under, as well as storage boxes. I could
even order [laser cut wooden ones][1] from Amazon for a few bucks.

I'm now only using those for any new fig as it streamlines the assembly process.
I start by adding [magnetic stickers][2] to the bottom of each base, then
glueing the mini on the base. That was, I can put all my minis on a metal plank
and basecoat them using a spray easily.
