All my minis have magnetized bases. I glue a magnetized sticker under each base.
As most of my minis are now on 25mm round bases, I can simply order the matching
magnets from Amazon and glue them.

My main reason for adding magnetized bases was for storage. Doing so I can just
put all my minis in a box with a steel sheet at the bottom and don't care about
them bumping into each other.

But what I also discovered is that it helped me for basecoating and for painting
as well.

I add the magnetic sticker to the base as soon as I glue the mini on the base,
even before basecoating. That way, I just have to put the minis in a nice row on
a steel plank (I use the cover of a biscuit box in metal for that), and base
coat on that. That way I can spray all over it without having the mini tumbling
because of the wind. At some point I had been using Blu Tack to keep my minis in
place, but magnetized bases is so much easier.

As for painting, I now have a few metal shelves on my painting desk, and I can
just drop minis on it easily without them ever falling from the shelves.
