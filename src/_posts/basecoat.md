Still following my principle of doing stuff on the cheap, I wanted to avoid
using the expensive Games Workshop basecoat sprays.

For that, I use the [Montana set of spray cans][1]. They have a large range of
available colors that you can use for basecoating. They cost about 5â‚¬ a can, and
the quality of it is impressive. It attaches well to the minis, covering it
perfectly and the nuzzle can help doing very fine targeting. 

I recommence shaking them well before use and do a few first sprays on a bit of
cardboard on the side. Otherwise you might end up with bloated paint that will
hide minis details and will be hard to paint over.

I currently have sprays of White (as my default), but also green, red, brown,
bone, flesh and putrid flesh for various types of minis. I found that it greatly
helped me paint a whole horde of Zombis (Zombicide) or orcs. Be careful though
as you might not have a 100% exact match between the color in the basecoat and
the one in your painting. It wasn't an issue for me, though.
