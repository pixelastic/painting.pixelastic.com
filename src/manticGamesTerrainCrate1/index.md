I backed the [Mantic Games Terrain Crate](https://www.manticgames.com/games/terrain-crate/) kickstarter a few years back and received a lot of dungeon furnitures. Chests, debris, tables, chairs, bookshelves, and more. 

Here are a few pictures of them, when used in my games.

This was an old arcane library, forgotten for centuries, and under a permanent silence spell. Some of the furniture were actually mimics, and the big boulder was animated and made regular cycles around the room.
