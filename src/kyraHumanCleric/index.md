This is Kyra, our Human Cleric of Sarenrae, with finally a miniature that accurately represents her with her magical glass scimitar and unmovable shield.

I stayed in my comfort zone here, but took care to keep only a limited amount of colors. Blue, gold and silver. With a touch of brass for the equipment.

I don't know how to paint glass, but I think the torch turned out ok.
