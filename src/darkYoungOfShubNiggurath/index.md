This is a Dark Young of Shub-Niggurath from the Mansions of Madness boardgame, but also a very nice miniature full of details to practice.

Here is a picture when it was almost finished. I just had the base to dry brush, but I realized it was missing something. It was too... mundane (as much as an horror from the great beyond could be).

So I repainted the tongue in a bright color to attract gazes.
