I used some of my new acquired Speed Paints to paint a bunch of World of Warcraft miniatures I had. The miniatures are coming from the board game, that I bought second hand, and never played. I only kept the miniatures.

The ghouls I had already started painting in a more traditional fashion before getting the Speed Paints, though.

For the murlocs, I did the traditional Murlocs colors, and some I painted in more muted colors, like the Drowners from the Witcher serie.

With the Tritons and Murlocs, I have enough miniatures to populate a Sea/Swamp type encounter if needed. They are smaller scale than my usual miniatures, so they could easily represent low level creatures.
