Here is the toy when I bought it. I knew I could paint the rocks in a convincing fashion using some modeling paste to give some texture, because I had done it before.

What to do with the dune and the water, though, I wasn't sure.

Here is the other piece of terrain. Could work as a small barrow as well. The holes are meant to be used to fit trees, and I intend to convert some playmobil trees as well. What I'm concerned about with this hill is in terms of gameplay; if there is enough room to make miniatures fit on it...

And a patch of sand... I thought I could maybe paint that as a small pond. I have no experience with painting water, so it could be a way to try.

Here they are, textured, waiting for the paste to dry.
