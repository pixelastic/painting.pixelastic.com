I got my hands on those empty homeopathic tubes. I'm sure there is something I can build with them, but I haven't found exactly what yet.

I [asked on reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/TerrainBuilding/comments/iac7d6/i_got_my_hands_on_a_bunch_of_those_homeopathy/), and there were a few good ideas there, but I think most people have the wrong scale in mind. Those tubes are actually pretty small; slightly taller than a lighter.
