I found the following toy in a garage sale. It's a Happy Meal toy (from MacDonalds), where you have to grab a plastic key from two plastic handles.

I didn't really care about the toy, but the two snakes inside grabbed my attention.

I had a very hard time opening the toy as it was screwed very tightly and the screws where in placed I couldn't get to. So I had to bend and twist the plastic until I could rip it appart.

Finally, I managed to extract the two snakes, and they where sitting on perfect round bases, I didn't even needed to base them.
